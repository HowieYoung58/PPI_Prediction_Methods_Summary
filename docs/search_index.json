Understanding and predicting PPIs is therefore fundamental in fields such as structural biology, molecular biophysics, drug discovery, and systems biology. Experimental techniques—such as Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H), Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), affinity purification–mass spectrometry (AP–MS), and cross-linking MS—provide powerful ways to detect interactions, but these approaches can be costly, low-throughput, or limited in coverage. As a result, computational prediction of PPIs has become essential for large-scale screening and mechanistic understanding. This chapter provides an overview of the main computational paradigms used in PPI prediction and outlines their conceptual differences, input requirements, and typical applications. 1.1 Why Computational PPI Prediction Matters Computational models help address several limitations of experimental methods: High throughput: Predict interactions at the proteome scale. Low cost: Reduce the need for extensive wet-lab screening. Hypothesis generation: Identify candidates for validation. Structural insight: Predict binding interfaces and complex conformations. Integration of diverse data sources: Combine sequence, structure, evolution, and literature. Computational predictions are especially useful when: structural data is incomplete, experimental conditions are difficult to mimic, high-throughput screening is required (e.g., drug target identification), or evolution-based insights can reveal conserved interaction patterns. 1.2 Categories of Computational PPI Prediction Methods Current computational approaches to PPI prediction can be broadly divided into five major categories, each with different assumptions, data dependencies, and output types. These categories correspond to Chapters 2–6 of this book. 1. Docking-Based (Structure-Based) Methods Use 3D protein structures as input and generate possible complex conformations using: rigid-body or flexible-body docking energy scoring interface restraints Representative tools: HADDOCK, HDOCK, ClusPro, ZDOCK, GRAMM, pyDock These methods aim to predict how two proteins bind (binding mode). 2. Structure-Based Interface Analysis These methods evaluate existing protein complexes to determine whether: the interface is physically realistic, the complex is biologically meaningful, the interaction is stable. Representative tool: PDBePISA Often used after docking or AlphaFold-Multimer predictions. 3. Sequence / Knowledge–Based Prediction These models rely on: amino acid sequences evolutionary co-variation protein domains biological networks literature mining Representative tools: STRING, PrePPI, PPI-Miner, COTH These methods answer whether two proteins might interact, but rarely predict complex geometry. 4. Deep Learning–Based PPI Prediction End-to-end neural architectures that use learned representations (embeddings) from: Transformers protein language models (e.g., ESM, ProtBERT) graph neural networks (GNNs) Representative tools/models: D-SCRIPT, DeepPurpose (PPI module), MAPE-PPI These approaches can capture subtle patterns beyond handcrafted features. 5. Structure Generation Approaches These methods directly generate complex structures from sequence inputs. Representative model: AlphaFold-Multimer Features: predicts complex geometry outputs confidence metrics (pLDDT, ipTM, pTM) can be combined with docking-based refinement or interface scoring This paradigm is increasingly used in structural proteomics and binder engineering. 1.3 When to Use Each Category Question Recommended Methods “Do A and B likely interact?” STRING, PrePPI, D-SCRIPT, DeepPurpose “What might the interface look like?” Docking tools (HADDOCK, ClusPro, HDOCK) “Is this predicted complex stable?” PDBePISA “Can we generate a complex structure directly from sequence?” AlphaFold-Multimer “I want large-scale computational screening.” Sequence-based + Deep Learning models This book organizes the chapters according to this logic. 1.4 Structure of This Book Chapter 2 — Docking-based prediction tools Chapter 3 — Structure-based interface and complex evaluation Chapter 4 — Sequence-/knowledge-based prediction models Chapter 5 — Deep learning–based models Chapter 6 — Structure-generation approaches such as AlphaFold-Multimer Chapter 7 — References &amp; resources Each chapter contains: theoretical overview representative tools comparison tables input/output format strengths &amp; weaknesses practical tips for using each tool 1.5 Suggested Reading Recommended reviews and references will be collected in Chapter 7.

These approaches rely on physical or statistical scoring functions and often explore a large search space of relative orientations between proteins. Docking methods are particularly useful when: structures of individual monomers are available the interface is unknown experimental structural data is limited refinement of predicted complexes is needed validating interactions suggested by sequence-based models This chapter summarizes six widely used protein–protein docking tools: HADDOCK, HDOCK Server, ClusPro, ZDOCK, GRAMM, and pyDock. 2.1 Overview of Docking Approaches Docking methods typically follow three major steps: 2.1.1. Sampling {-} Explore relative orientations and positions of the two proteins (rigid-body, soft-body, flexible docking). 2.1.2. Scoring {-} Evaluate poses using: - van der Waals energy - electrostatics - desolvation - empirical potentials - knowledge-based scores - constraint penalties 2.1.3. Clustering &amp; Ranking {-} Group similar poses and rank clusters based on energy or cluster size. Docking approaches can be further categorized as: Rigid-body docking (ZDOCK, GRAMM) Flexible docking (HADDOCK) Template-based docking (HDOCK) Scoring-only workflows (pyDock) 2.2 HADDOCK HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven biomolecular DOCKing) A powerful data-driven docking platform that integrates experimental or predicted interface restraints.

Sequence-based and deep learning models (Chapters 4–5) can provide interaction candidates before docking. Structure-generation tools like AlphaFold-Multimer (Chapter 6) may replace docking in some cases but still benefit from refinement.

Among all available tools, PDBePISA is the most widely used platform for analyzing macromolecular interfaces, assemblies, and stability. This chapter summarizes the principles, metrics, and practical applications of PDBePISA in protein–protein interaction (PPI) studies. 3.1 Purpose of Structure-Based Interface Analysis Docking methods (Chapter 2) can generate thousands of possible binding orientations. Structure analysis tools—such as PDBePISA—help answer critical questions: Is the predicted interface thermodynamically stable? Is the interaction likely to occur in solution, not just in the crystal? What is the interface area, buried surface, or energetic contributions? Which residues form the interface? Are the hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic contacts plausible? Does the complex appear to be a biologically relevant assembly? Thus, PDBePISA is a validation and interpretation tool for structural models, whether derived from: docking AlphaFold-Multimer cryo-EM crystallography NMR 3.2 What Is PDBePISA? PDBePISA (Protein Interfaces, Surfaces &amp; Assemblies) is a web server developed by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) for: calculating macromolecular interfaces analyzing biological assemblies estimating thermodynamic stability identifying interface residues, contacts, and networks PISA operates on atomic-level structures from PDB or user-uploaded models. Website: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/ 3.3 How PDBePISA Works PISA evaluates protein–protein interfaces using: 1. Buried Surface Area (BSA) The area lost upon complex formation (Å²). Large BSA values (≥ 1,000–2,000 Å²) typically indicate stable interfaces. 2. Solvation Free Energy Gain (ΔGint) Estimates the free energy change associated with interface formation. Negative values → stable interaction More negative = stronger predicted interaction 3. Hydrogen Bond and Salt Bridge Networks PISA identifies: H-bonds (distance + angle criteria) salt bridges (charged side-chain interactions) hydrophobic patches 4. Interface Residue Mapping Provides detailed residue-level interactions, including: donor/acceptor atoms contact distances contributing side chains 5. Biological Assembly Prediction PISA distinguishes between: biologically relevant interfaces crystallographic artifacts (crystal contacts) based on thermodynamic scoring and symmetry analysis. 3.4 Key Outputs of PDBePISA When a structure is analyzed, PISA provides: • Interface Summary Interface area Solvation energy Number of hydrogen bonds Number of salt bridges Hydrophobic contacts • Assembly Summary Predicted quaternary structures (e.g., dimer, trimer, tetramer). • Stability Prediction Includes: ΔGdiss — estimated dissociation free energy Complex stability score A positive ΔGdiss indicates the complex is stable in solution. • Detailed Contact Map Residue-by-residue interface interactions, useful for: mutagenesis design engineering hotspot identification cross-model comparison 3.5 When to Use PDBePISA PDBePISA is useful in the following scenarios: 1. After Docking (Chapter 2) To validate whether docking poses are: physically reasonable likely stable in solution consistent with known interaction patterns 2. After AlphaFold-Multimer Prediction (Chapter 6) AlphaFold often predicts multimers, but not all interfaces are realistic. Use PISA to check: interface area ΔGint hydrogen bond network potential crystal-like contacts multimer assembly correctness 3. Crystal Structure Interpretation To determine if biological assemblies differ from PDB’s asymmetric unit. 4. Identifying Potential Hotspots Residues with strong contributions to binding energy can be used for: mutagenesis binder design inhibitor development 3.6 PDBePISA vs. Docking Scores Metric Docking Tools PDBePISA Purpose Ranking poses Validating physicochemical plausibility Type Empirical/physics scoring Thermodynamic + geometric analysis Outputs Pose score, clusters ΔGint, ΔGdiss, BSA, residue interactions Sensitivity Sensitive to scoring function Sensitive to interface geometry Best used for Pose selection Biological relevance evaluation Docking answers: “Which orientation seems best?” PISA answers: “Is this orientation stable and realistic?” 3.7 Practical Workflow Integration A recommended pipeline integrating Chapter 2 and 3: Generate monomer structures AlphaFold2 / ESMFold / experimental structures Initial docking ZDOCK / HDOCK / ClusPro to generate large pose sets Refinement HADDOCK / RosettaDock / AlphaFold-Multimer Interface analysis using PISA Confirm interface area size Check ΔGint sign Check the number of H-bonds / salt bridges Ensure plausible packing geometry Ranking + filtering Combine docking score + PISA metrics Experimental design Use interface hotspots to design mutations for validation 3.8 Advantages and Limitations Advantages Provides residue-level and energy-based insight Distinguishes real interfaces from crystal artifacts Applicable to any structural model Very intuitive visualization Limitations Requires accurate atomic coordinates Does not generate poses (not a docking tool) Energetics are approximate, not true MD/DFT energies Sensitive to model quality (garbage-in → garbage-out) 3.9 Summary PDBePISA is an essential tool for validating and interpreting PPI structural models. It complements the docking methods described in Chapter 2 and the structure-generation models of Chapter 6. In typical workflows, PISA is used to: assess interface stability evaluate docking poses validate AlphaFold-Multimer complexes identify interface residues explore biological assemblies This makes it one of the most valuable and reliable tools for structure-based PPI analysis.

These approaches are particularly useful when protein structures are unavailable, or when large-scale network inference is required. This chapter summarizes four widely used resources and models: STRING PrePPI PPI-Miner COTH Together, they represent the major paradigms for sequence-level and knowledge-driven PPI prediction. 4.1 Overview of Sequence / Knowledge-Based Methods Unlike docking or structural analysis (Chapters 2–3), sequence- and knowledge-based approaches aim to answer: “Do protein A and B interact?” (Without predicting how they bind.) These methods make use of one or more of the following information sources: 4.1.1. Evolutionary Features Orthology Co-evolution signals Sequence similarity Phylogenetic profiles 4.1.2. Functional Annotation Gene Ontology (GO) Pfam / InterPro domains KEGG pathways 4.1.3. Literature Mining &amp; Text Evidence co-mention in articles NLP extraction of interactions curated knowledge bases 4.1.4. Biological Network Topology shared neighbors clustering in interaction networks pathway co-membership 4.1.5. Homology-Based Templates Predicted interactions are transferred from known complexes with homologs. These features are combined to produce a final interaction probability score. 4.2 STRING STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) One of the most widely used databases for large-scale PPI predictions.

Proteome-wide filtering Before expensive docking or AlphaFold-Multimer predictions. 4.7.2. Finding candidates for experimental validation STRING/PrePPI are commonly used in early discovery. 4.7.3. Supporting evidence Combine with: docking scores interface energy (PDBePISA) deep learning predictions (Chapter 5) 4.7.4. When structural data is unavailable COTH and PrePPI can still provide useful interaction hypotheses. 4.8 Integrating Knowledge-Based Tools into a Workflow A practical example: STRING → identify co-functional proteins likely to interact PrePPI / COTH → obtain structural analogs or domain-level interaction hints Docking (Chapter 2) → predict 3D complex PDBePISA (Chapter 3) → analyze interface stability AlphaFold-Multimer (Chapter 6) → generate high-confidence structures Deep Learning (Chapter 5) → cross-check sequence-level plausibility This multi-stage screening increases reliability and reduces false positives. 4.9 Summary Sequence- and knowledge-based PPI prediction methods provide broad coverage, fast inference, and useful functional context, although they lack structural specificity. They serve as essential tools for hypothesis generation and proteome-wide screening and complement both docking-based and deep learning–based predictions.

Unlike sequence/knowledge-based models (Chapter 4), DL approaches do not rely on handcrafted features, and unlike docking methods (Chapter 2), they do not require 3D structures. This chapter introduces three representative deep learning frameworks for PPI prediction: D-SCRIPT DeepPurpose (PPI module) MAPE-PPI We also summarize the general DL paradigms used in PPI prediction and how these models complement other approaches. 5.1 Why Deep Learning for PPI Prediction? Traditional PPI prediction methods struggle to capture: high-order sequence dependencies non-linear interaction patterns co-evolutionary features hidden in raw sequences structural constraints not explicitly modeled Deep learning addresses these challenges by learning latent representations of proteins that encode biological, chemical, and evolutionary signals. Advantages of DL-based PPI prediction Requires only sequences Captures non-linear patterns automatically Scales to large datasets Compatible with pretrained protein language models Amenable to transfer learning and fine-tuning Limitations Requires substantial training data Interpretability can be low Predictions may lack structural detail Sensitive to dataset bias 5.2 General Deep Learning Paradigms for PPI Prediction Current DL-based models fall into several broad categories: Siamese / Twin Network Models Two proteins are encoded separately → embeddings concatenated → classifier predicts interaction. Used by: - D-SCRIPT - MAPE-PPI - DeepPurpose (PPI module) Graph Neural Network (GNN) Models Represent proteins as residue-level or domain-level graphs. Captures: - structural constraints - long-range interactions - co-evolution signals Transformer-Based Embedding Models Use pretrained protein language models such as: ESM ProtBERT ProtT5 MSA Transformer These embeddings feed downstream PPI classifiers. Contact Map Prediction Models Some DL tools predict residue–residue contact maps between protein pairs. Used by: - D-SCRIPT - Several co-evolution + DL hybrid models 5.3 D-SCRIPT D-SCRIPT is a highly influential DL model for predicting PPIs directly from amino acid sequences.

Proteome-wide screening Much faster than docking or AlphaFold-Multimer. 5.7.2. Dataset-driven tasks Especially when curated labels exist (BioGRID / DIP / STRING). 5.7.3. Supporting evidence DL models provide probability estimates that complement: docking poses (Chapter 2) interface stability analysis (Chapter 3) sequence-based predictions (Chapter 4) 5.7.4. Cases lacking structural data DL methods rely solely on sequences. 5.8 Integrating Deep Learning with Other Prediction Methods A recommended workflow: Use DL models to predict PPI probability (D-SCRIPT / DeepPurpose / MAPE-PPI) Filter high-confidence candidates → Reduces computational burden on docking or AF-M. Generate complex structures for top candidates AlphaFold-Multimer (Chapter 6) Docking methods (Chapter 2) Evaluate interface using PDBePISA (Chapter 3) Refine or redesign interactions via mutation predictions, ML-based scoring, or experimental assays. 5.9 Summary Deep learning has become a central approach in computational PPI prediction, offering significant improvements over traditional feature-based methods. Models such as D-SCRIPT, DeepPurpose, and MAPE-PPI demonstrate how rich sequence embeddings and neural architectures can uncover complex biological patterns. DL-based PPI predictors: require minimal input scale well complement structural modeling tools provide valuable interaction likelihoods However, they still lack structural mechanistic detail, which must be obtained from docking, interface analysis, or structure-generation models (Chapter 6).

In contrast, structure-generation approaches directly produce 3D complex models from amino acid sequences, without requiring docking or predefined interface hypotheses. The most successful and widely adopted structure-generation tool for PPIs is AlphaFold-Multimer (AF-Multimer), an extension of AlphaFold2 capable of predicting protein complexes. 6.1 What Is AlphaFold-Multimer? AlphaFold-Multimer is a deep learning framework designed to predict multi-chain protein complex structures using: joint MSAs inter-chain co-evolution geometric pattern learning iterative recycling strategies AF-Multimer outputs complete 3D structural models containing all protein chains in the complex. This enables accurate prediction of binding interfaces, assembly stoichiometry, and global arrangement—something docking alone often cannot reliably achieve. 6.2 How AlphaFold-Multimer Works AF-Multimer extends the original AlphaFold2 architecture in several ways: 6.2.1. Joint MSA Construction AF-M attempts to pair homologous sequences across different species, identifying co-evolutionary signals between chains. Paired MSAs (preferred) Unpaired MSAs (fallback) Concatenation of MSAs for all chains 6.2.2. Evoformer-Multimer Blocks The Evoformer is extended to enable: cross-chain attention pair representation between chains inter-chain geometric reasoning This allows the network to infer: interface residue positions long-range inter-chain contacts the arrangement of chains in 3D space 6.2.3. Structure Module The structure module generates 3D coordinates using: invariant point attention (IPA) torsion-angle prediction iterative recycling for refinement 6.2.4. Recycling Predictions are refined by feeding outputs back into the model several times, improving global geometry and interface accuracy. 6.3 Key Confidence Metrics (pLDDT, pTM, ipTM) AlphaFold-Multimer provides several critical confidence metrics useful for assessing prediction quality: pLDDT — Local Confidence A per-residue score (0–100) indicating local structural accuracy. &gt;90: very high local confidence 70–90: reasonable &lt;70: unreliable local structure pTM — Predicted TM-score A global confidence metric evaluating the overall accuracy of the folded structure. ipTM — Inter-chain TM-score A unique metric for multimers that measures confidence in inter-chain geometry. ipTM is the most important indicator of whether AF-Multimer believes two proteins truly interact. &gt; 0.6 → strong interface confidence 0.4–0.6 → uncertain interaction &lt; 0.4 → likely non-interacting or incorrect interface Recommended composite score: 0.8 × ipTM + 0.2 × pTM Used for ranking multiple Multimer models. 6.4 Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) AF-Multimer outputs a PAE matrix describing predicted alignment error between all pairs of residues. Interpretation: Low inter-chain PAE → reliable interface High inter-chain PAE → unstable / noisy binding interface PAE is often more informative than pLDDT for multimer evaluation. 6.5 Evaluating AF-Multimer Predictions with DockQ AF-Multimer structures are commonly benchmarked using DockQ, an established metric for evaluating protein complex models. DockQ incorporates: Fnat (fraction of native contacts) LRMSD (ligand RMSD) iRMSD (interface RMSD) DockQ score interpretation: Score Quality &gt;0.80 High-quality complex 0.50–0.80 Medium 0.23–0.50 Acceptable &lt;0.23 Incorrect DockQ is frequently used to: benchmark AF-Multimer against docking evaluate modeled complexes compare multiple AF-M outputs 6.6 Advantages of AlphaFold-Multimer Predicts complexes directly from sequence A major advantage over docking. Often more accurate than docking Especially for obligate complexes with strong co-evolution signals. Provides residues-level interface confidence Through PAE and ipTM. Useful for protein design workflows Including: binder design enzymatic complexes de novo scaffolds RFdiffusion outputs Does not require templates or known interface information 6.7 Limitations of AlphaFold-Multimer Despite its strengths, AF-Multimer has important limitations: Limited for transient or weak interactions Such interactions often lack evolutionary signals → low ipTM. Sensitive to MSA pairing Incorrect pairing → hallucinated or incorrect interfaces. May generate biologically irrelevant assemblies Spurious compact interfaces are common. Cannot explore alternative binding modes Docking is still needed for sampling conformational diversity. Poor performance for: intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) large oligomers (&gt;4–6 chains) systems with competing binding partners flexible multi-domain proteins Not ideal for mutation scanning Relative ΔΔG is not reliable compared to specialized energetics tools. 6.8 Integrating AF-Multimer with Docking, PISA, and Deep Learning A robust prediction workflow typically combines AF-Multimer with other methods: Step 1 — Sequence-Level Screening From Chapter 4–5: STRING PrePPI D-SCRIPT DeepPurpose MAPE-PPI → identify candidates likely to interact. Step 2 — AF-Multimer Structure Prediction Run AF-Multimer using: multiple seeds paired MSAs rank models by (0.8×ipTM + 0.2×pTM) Step 3 — Evaluate Interfaces Use: PAE ipTM pLDDT Step 4 — Complement with Docking (Chapter 2) Docking is useful when: AF-Multimer fails ipTM is low interfaces are ambiguous multiple poses are possible Use methods such as: HADDOCK HDOCK ClusPro ZDOCK Step 5 — Interface Stability with PDBePISA (Chapter 3) Evaluate: ΔGint ΔGdiss interface area H-bond networks Step 6 — Final Ranking with DockQ Select the top structural models Compare across AF-Multimer and docking predictions 6.9 Recommended Best Practices Always check ipTM and PAE, not only pLDDT Use multiple model seeds (8–20) Avoid trusting overly compact “hallucinated” complexes For weak interactions → use docking + PISA + Deep Learning voting For multi-chain systems → run subcomplexes separately Carefully curate MSAs for multimer inputs Combine AF-Multimer with docking for alternative poses 6.10 Summary AlphaFold-Multimer represents a major advance in protein complex prediction, enabling structural modeling of PPIs directly from sequences. However, its performance varies depending on interaction type, evolutionary signals, and MSA construction. To achieve reliable PPI modeling, AF-Multimer must be used in conjunction with: docking (Chapter 2) interface analysis (Chapter 3) sequence- or deep-learning predictors (Chapters 4–5) A hybrid workflow remains the most robust approach for accurate structural PPI prediction.
