# Structure Generation Methods: AlphaFold-Multimer {#structure-generation}

Traditional docking-based methods (Chapter 2) attempt to sample and score possible orientations between proteins using structural information.  
In contrast, **structure-generation approaches** directly produce **3D complex models from amino acid sequences**, without requiring docking or predefined interface hypotheses.

The most successful and widely adopted structure-generation tool for PPIs is **AlphaFold-Multimer (AF-Multimer)**, an extension of AlphaFold2 capable of predicting protein complexes.

---

## 6.1 What Is AlphaFold-Multimer? {-}

**AlphaFold-Multimer** is a deep learning framework designed to predict **multi-chain protein complex structures** using:

- joint MSAs  
- inter-chain co-evolution  
- geometric pattern learning  
- iterative recycling strategies  

AF-Multimer outputs complete 3D structural models containing all protein chains in the complex.  
This enables accurate prediction of **binding interfaces**, **assembly stoichiometry**, and **global arrangement**—something docking alone often cannot reliably achieve.

---

## 6.2 How AlphaFold-Multimer Works {-}

AF-Multimer extends the original AlphaFold2 architecture in several ways:

### **1. Joint MSA Construction** {-}
AF-M attempts to pair homologous sequences across different species, identifying **co-evolutionary signals** between chains.

- Paired MSAs (preferred)  
- Unpaired MSAs (fallback)  
- Concatenation of MSAs for all chains  

### **2. Evoformer-Multimer Blocks** {-}
The Evoformer is extended to enable:

- cross-chain attention  
- pair representation between chains  
- inter-chain geometric reasoning  

This allows the network to infer:

- interface residue positions  
- long-range inter-chain contacts  
- the arrangement of chains in 3D space  

### **3. Structure Module** {-}
The structure module generates 3D coordinates using:

- invariant point attention (IPA)  
- torsion-angle prediction  
- iterative recycling for refinement  

### **4. Recycling** {-}
Predictions are refined by feeding outputs back into the model several times, improving global geometry and interface accuracy.

---

## 6.3 Key Confidence Metrics (pLDDT, pTM, ipTM) {-}

AlphaFold-Multimer provides several critical confidence metrics useful for assessing prediction quality:

### **1. pLDDT — Local Confidence** {-}
A per-residue score (0–100) indicating local structural accuracy.

- >90: very high local confidence  
- 70–90: reasonable  
- <70: unreliable local structure  

### **2. pTM — Predicted TM-score** {-}
A global confidence metric evaluating the overall accuracy of the folded structure.

### **3. ipTM — Inter-chain TM-score** {-}
A **unique metric for multimers** that measures confidence in *inter-chain* geometry.

ipTM is the most important indicator of whether AF-Multimer believes two proteins truly interact.

- **> 0.6** → strong interface confidence  
- **0.4–0.6** → uncertain interaction  
- **< 0.4** → likely non-interacting or incorrect interface  

### **Recommended composite score:** {-}
- 0.8 * ipTM + 0.2 * pTM
Used for ranking multiple Multimer models.

---

## 6.4 Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) {-}

AF-Multimer outputs a **PAE matrix** describing predicted alignment error between all pairs of residues.

Interpretation:

- **Low inter-chain PAE** → reliable interface  
- **High inter-chain PAE** → unstable / noisy binding interface  

PAE is often more informative than pLDDT for multimer evaluation.

---

## 6.5 Evaluating AF-Multimer Predictions with DockQ {-}

AF-Multimer structures are commonly benchmarked using **DockQ**, an established metric for evaluating protein complex models.

DockQ incorporates:

- Fnat (fraction of native contacts)  
- LRMSD (ligand RMSD)  
- iRMSD (interface RMSD)  

### **DockQ score interpretation:** {-}

| Score | Quality |
|-------|---------|
| >0.80 | High-quality complex |
| 0.50–0.80 | Medium |
| 0.23–0.50 | Acceptable |
| <0.23 | Incorrect |

DockQ is frequently used to:

- benchmark AF-Multimer against docking  
- evaluate modeled complexes  
- compare multiple AF-M outputs

## 6.6 Advantages of AlphaFold-Multimer {-}

### **1. Predicts complexes directly from sequence** {-}
A major advantage over docking.

### **2. Often more accurate than docking** {-}
Especially for obligate complexes with strong co-evolution signals.

### **3. Provides residues-level interface confidence** {-}
Through PAE and ipTM.

### **4. Useful for protein design workflows** {-}
Including:

- binder design  
- enzymatic complexes  
- de novo scaffolds  
- RFdiffusion outputs  

### **5. Does not require templates or known interface information** {-}

---

## 6.7 Limitations of AlphaFold-Multimer {-}

Despite its strengths, AF-Multimer has important limitations:

### **1. Limited for transient or weak interactions** {-}
Such interactions often lack evolutionary signals → low ipTM.

### **2. Sensitive to MSA pairing** {-}
Incorrect pairing → hallucinated or incorrect interfaces.

### **3. May generate biologically irrelevant assemblies** {-}
Spurious compact interfaces are common.

### **4. Cannot explore alternative binding modes** {-}
Docking is still needed for sampling conformational diversity.

### **5. Poor performance for:** {-}
- intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)  
- large oligomers (>4–6 chains)  
- systems with competing binding partners  
- flexible multi-domain proteins  

### **6. Not ideal for mutation scanning** {-}
Relative ΔΔG is not reliable compared to specialized energetics tools.

## 6.8 Integrating AF-Multimer with Docking, PISA, and Deep Learning {-}

A robust prediction workflow typically combines AF-Multimer with other methods:

### **Step 1 — Sequence-Level Screening** {-}
From Chapter 4–5:

- STRING  
- PrePPI  
- D-SCRIPT  
- DeepPurpose  
- MAPE-PPI  

→ identify candidates likely to interact.

### **Step 2 — AF-Multimer Structure Prediction** {-}
Run AF-Multimer using:

- multiple seeds  
- paired MSAs  
- rank models by (0.8 × ipTM + 0.2 × pTM)

### **Step 3 — Evaluate Interfaces** {-} 
Use:

- PAE  
- ipTM  
- pLDDT  

### **Step 4 — Complement with Docking (Chapter 2)** {-}
Docking is useful when:

- AF-Multimer fails  
- ipTM is low  
- interfaces are ambiguous  
- multiple poses are possible  

Use methods such as:

- HADDOCK  
- HDOCK  
- ClusPro  
- ZDOCK  

### **Step 5 — Interface Stability with PDBePISA (Chapter 3)** {-}
Evaluate:

- ΔG<sub>int</sub>  
- ΔG<sub>diss</sub>  
- interface area  
- H-bond networks  

### **Step 6 — Final Ranking with DockQ** {-}
- Select the top structural models  
- Compare across AF-Multimer and docking predictions  

---

## 6.9 Recommended Best Practices {-}

- Always check **ipTM and PAE**, not only pLDDT  
- Use **multiple model seeds** (8–20)  
- Avoid trusting overly compact “hallucinated” complexes  
- For weak interactions → use docking + PISA + Deep Learning voting  
- For multi-chain systems → run subcomplexes separately  
- Carefully curate MSAs for multimer inputs  
- Combine AF-Multimer with docking for alternative poses  

---

## 6.10 Summary {-}

AlphaFold-Multimer represents a major advance in protein complex prediction, enabling structural modeling of PPIs directly from sequences.  
However, its performance varies depending on interaction type, evolutionary signals, and MSA construction.  
To achieve reliable PPI modeling, AF-Multimer must be used in conjunction with:

- docking (Chapter 2)  
- interface analysis (Chapter 3)  
- sequence- or deep-learning predictors (Chapters 4–5)  

A hybrid workflow remains the most robust approach for accurate structural PPI prediction.
