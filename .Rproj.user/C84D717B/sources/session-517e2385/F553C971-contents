# Sequence- and Knowledge-Based PPI Prediction Models {#sequence-knowledge}

Sequence- and knowledge-based PPI prediction methods rely on evolutionary, functional, domain, or literature-derived information rather than 3D structural data.  
These approaches are particularly useful when **protein structures are unavailable**, or when **large-scale network inference** is required.

This chapter summarizes four widely used resources and models:

- **STRING**
- **PrePPI**
- **PPI-Miner**
- **COTH**

Together, they represent the major paradigms for sequence-level and knowledge-driven PPI prediction.

## 4.1 Overview of Sequence / Knowledge-Based Methods {-}

Unlike docking or structural analysis (Chapters 2–3), sequence- and knowledge-based approaches aim to answer:

> **“Do protein A and B interact?”**  
> (Without predicting how they bind.)

These methods make use of one or more of the following information sources:

### **4.1.1. Evolutionary Features** {-}
- Orthology
- Co-evolution signals
- Sequence similarity
- Phylogenetic profiles

### **4.1.2. Functional Annotation** {-}
- Gene Ontology (GO)
- Pfam / InterPro domains
- KEGG pathways

### **4.1.3. Literature Mining & Text Evidence** {-}
- co-mention in articles
- NLP extraction of interactions
- curated knowledge bases

### **4.1.4. Biological Network Topology** {-}
- shared neighbors
- clustering in interaction networks
- pathway co-membership

### **4.1.5. Homology-Based Templates** {-}
Predicted interactions are transferred from known complexes with homologs.

These features are combined to produce a final **interaction probability score**.

## 4.2 STRING {-}

**STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins)**  
One of the most widely used databases for large-scale PPI predictions.

Website: https://string-db.org/

### Key Features {-}
- Integrates **multiple evidence channels**:
  - experimental data
  - text mining
  - co-expression
  - genomic neighborhood
  - gene fusion
  - co-occurrence
  - curated databases
- Interaction scores are **probabilistic** and evidence-weighted.
- Organism-wide PPI network available for hundreds of species.

### Input {-}
- Protein name / gene ID
- Organism selection

### Output {-}
- Interaction scoring matrix  
- Network visualization  
- Evidence breakdown  
- Functional modules  

### Advantages {-}
- Comprehensive and easy to navigate  
- Strong integration of heterogeneous data  
- Suitable for **global PPI network analysis**

### Limitations {-}
- Does not predict binding interface  
- Text-mined connections may be noisy  
- Not designed for structural predictions

## 4.3 PrePPI {-}

**PrePPI** is a hybrid sequence- and structure-informed PPI predictor.

Website: https://honiglab.c2b2.columbia.edu/PrePPI/

### Key Features {-}
- Integrates >10 evidence types:
  - homology-based structural templates  
  - functional annotation  
  - co-expression  
  - phylogenetic profiles  
  - domain interactions  
- Bayesian framework combining all evidence  
- Incorporates structural analogs even when structures are not available

### Input {-}
- Protein pairs (ID or sequence)

### Output {-}
- Interaction probability  
- Contribution breakdown of each evidence type  
- Structural template suggestions (when available)

### Advantages {-}
- Hybrid (sequence + structure) improves accuracy  
- High coverage for proteome-level predictions  
- Useful for hypothesis generation

### Limitations {-}
- Dependent on template availability  
- No full 3D complex output (unlike docking)

## 4.4 PPI-Miner {-}

**PPI-Miner** uses **literature mining (NLP)** to extract PPI evidence.

Website: http://caps.ncbs.res.in/ppiminer/

### Key Features {-}
- Extracts co-occurrences of protein names in PubMed articles  
- Uses NLP and text-pattern heuristics  
- Curates interaction keywords  

### Input {-}
- Gene symbol / protein name

### Output {-}
- Ranked list of candidate PPIs  
- Supporting literature evidence  
- Article references  

### Advantages {-}
- Finds literature-supported interactions not present in curated DBs  
- Can serve as complementary evidence to biochemical predictions

### Limitations {-}
- Sensitive to text-mining noise  
- No structural or sequence analysis  
- Limited to proteins discussed in literature

---

## 4.5 COTH {-}

**COTH (COmplex Threading and Homology modeling)** predicts PPI using **template-based modeling** without requiring full structural docking.

Website: https://zhanggroup.org/COTH/

### Key Features {-}
- Predicts interactions by threading sequence pairs onto known complex templates  
- Identifies interacting domains and interface residues  
- Assigns confidence scores (C-score)  
- Can work even when full structures are unknown

### Input {-}
- FASTA sequences of two proteins

### Output {-}
- Predicted interaction confidence  
- Interface residues  
- Representative complex template  

### Advantages {-}
- Better structural insight compared to other sequence-only methods  
- Does not require docking  
- Good when homologous templates exist

### Limitations {-}
- Template-limited  
- Structural detail lower than docking/AlphaFold-Multimer

## 4.6 Comparison of Sequence / Knowledge-Based Tools {-}

| Tool | Type | Data Sources | Output | Strengths | Limitations |
|------|------|--------------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **STRING** | Integrated / knowledge-based | Genomics, co-expression, text mining, experiments | PPI network + scores | Large-scale network; high coverage | Not structural; mixed noise |
| **PrePPI** | Hybrid (sequence + template) | Evolutionary, functional, templates | Interaction probability | Multi-evidence integration | No complex structure |
| **PPI-Miner** | Literature mining | PubMed articles | PPI + supporting texts | Finds literature-based interactions | No sequence/structure use |
| **COTH** | Template-based | Structural template DB + threading | Interface prediction | Provides structural hints | Template availability limited |

## 4.7 When to Use Sequence / Knowledge-Based Methods {-}

These models are best suited for:

### **4.7.1. Proteome-wide filtering** {-}
Before expensive docking or AlphaFold-Multimer predictions.

### **4.7.2. Finding candidates for experimental validation** {-}
STRING/PrePPI are commonly used in early discovery.

### **4.7.3. Supporting evidence** {-}
Combine with:

- docking scores  
- interface energy (PDBePISA)  
- deep learning predictions (Chapter 5)  

### **4.7.4. When structural data is unavailable** {-}
COTH and PrePPI can still provide useful interaction hypotheses.

## 4.8 Integrating Knowledge-Based Tools into a Workflow {-}

A practical example:

1. **STRING**  
   → identify co-functional proteins likely to interact  
2. **PrePPI / COTH**  
   → obtain structural analogs or domain-level interaction hints  
3. **Docking (Chapter 2)**  
   → predict 3D complex  
4. **PDBePISA (Chapter 3)**  
   → analyze interface stability  
5. **AlphaFold-Multimer (Chapter 6)**  
   → generate high-confidence structures  
6. **Deep Learning (Chapter 5)**  
   → cross-check sequence-level plausibility  

This multi-stage screening increases reliability and reduces false positives.

## 4.9 Summary {-}

Sequence- and knowledge-based PPI prediction methods provide **broad coverage**, **fast inference**, and **useful functional context**, although they lack structural specificity.  
They serve as essential tools for hypothesis generation and proteome-wide screening and complement both docking-based and deep learning–based predictions.
