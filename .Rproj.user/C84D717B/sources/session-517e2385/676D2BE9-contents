# Docking-Based (Structure-Based) PPI Prediction {#docking}

Computational docking methods aim to predict **how two proteins interact** by generating possible 3D complex structures (binding poses).  
These approaches rely on physical or statistical scoring functions and often explore a large search space of relative orientations between proteins.

Docking methods are particularly useful when:

- structures of individual monomers are available  
- the interface is unknown  
- experimental structural data is limited  
- refinement of predicted complexes is needed  
- validating interactions suggested by sequence-based models  

This chapter summarizes six widely used protein–protein docking tools:  
**HADDOCK**, **HDOCK Server**, **ClusPro**, **ZDOCK**, **GRAMM**, and **pyDock**.

## 2.1 Overview of Docking Approaches {-}

Docking methods typically follow three major steps:

2.1.1. **Sampling**  {-}
   Explore relative orientations and positions of the two proteins  
   (rigid-body, soft-body, flexible docking).

2.1.2. **Scoring**  {-}
   Evaluate poses using:
   - van der Waals energy  
   - electrostatics  
   - desolvation  
   - empirical potentials  
   - knowledge-based scores  
   - constraint penalties  

2.1.3. **Clustering & Ranking**  {-}
   Group similar poses and rank clusters based on energy or cluster size.

Docking approaches can be further categorized as:

- **Rigid-body docking** (ZDOCK, GRAMM)  
- **Flexible docking** (HADDOCK)  
- **Template-based docking** (HDOCK)  
- **Scoring-only workflows** (pyDock)

## 2.9 Practical Workflow Suggestions {-}

### **When starting without structural information** {-}
- Predict monomer structures (e.g., AlphaFold2, ESMFold)  
- Use ZDOCK or HDOCK for quick rigid docking  
- Refine top poses using HADDOCK  
- Evaluate stability using PDBePISA  

### **When interface residues are known or predicted** {-}
- Use HADDOCK with restraints  
- Evaluate clusters and perform flexible refinement  

### **When many protein pairs must be screened** {-}
- Use ZDOCK or GRAMM for initial docking  
- Rescore top poses using pyDock  

### **When sequences are available but structures are missing** {-}
- HDOCK (sequence input allowed)  
- Or predict structures first → docking  

---

## 2.10 Relation to Other Chapters {-}

- Structure analysis tools such as **PDBePISA** (Chapter 3) can validate docking results.  
- Sequence-based and deep learning models (Chapters 4–5) can provide interaction candidates before docking.  
- Structure-generation tools like **AlphaFold-Multimer** (Chapter 6) may replace docking in some cases but still benefit from refinement.
