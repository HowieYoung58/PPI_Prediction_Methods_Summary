This study note is a summary of **computational methods for Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) prediction**.  
Its goal is to organize existing tools, prediction paradigms, and representative models into clear methodological categories, enabling both beginners and researchers to quickly understand the landscape of PPI analysis.

The content is divided into five methodological categories:

1. **Docking-based methods**  
2. **Structure-based analysis and interface evaluation**  
3. **Sequence / knowledge–based prediction methods**  
4. **Deep learning–based approaches**  
5. **Structure-generation frameworks such as AlphaFold-Multimer**

Each chapter introduces the theory, representative tools, strengths, weaknesses, and practical usage suggestions.

This note was written using Rmarkdown. Thanks to **Yihui Xie and others** for providing the template.
